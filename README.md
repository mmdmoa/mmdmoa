### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Yolowex!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently making a desktop dns setter client.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on a FOSS project (since i'm busy and all)
- ðŸŒ³ My favorite open source project is no longer ~~âœ¨pygame-ceâœ¨~~, it's Flutter
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you hit gas, clutch and break at the same time while driving, the car takes a screenshot.
